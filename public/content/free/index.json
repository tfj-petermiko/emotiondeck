      "subtitle": "Clarity & Universal Understanding",
      "description": "This phase establishes a neutral and consistent foundation for studying emotion across different faces, genders, and ethnicities. It emphasises clarity, balance, and universality, allowing observers to focus purely on the emotional signal, free from external distraction. Designed as a baseline for comparison, it helps users recognise emotional nuances and build perceptual accuracy. It also serves as a psychological mirror, reminding us that emotion transcends cultural boundaries. Every face becomes a lesson in empathy and shared humanity, where emotion is a language understood by all. Through this openness, Phase 1 invites us to observe emotion as both art and science: simple, honest, and profoundly human.",

      "description": "This phase explores subtler states such as empathy, gratitude, and awe, encouraging observers to perceive emotional nuance and authenticity. It captures the warmth of human connection, bridging cultural differences and revealing the shared psychological patterns that define humanity. It offers a deeper encounter with authenticity, where emotion becomes a reflection of inner truth rather than a social performance.

The result is an evolving ability to recognise emotion as a spectrum rather than a label, fostering a richer and more human understanding of what we feel.",
